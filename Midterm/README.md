## Project Description

The project consists of a series of tasks implemented in Java. Below is a brief description of the main components of the project:

### Midtermarka.java

This class contains methods to solve the following tasks:

- **christmastree(int size, double radius)**: This method is intended to draw a Christmas tree but is currently not implemented.
- **divisibleDigitsSums(int m, int n)**: This method checks if the sum of the digits of `m` is divisible by the sum of the digits of `n` or vice versa.
- **containsTwinChar(String s)**: This method counts the number of words in the string `s` that contain consecutive identical characters.

### MidtermPane.java

This class extends `WinPane` and manages an array of `Turtle` objects. It includes methods to:

- Initialize the turtles with random positions and directions.
- **bestSeeker()**: This method identifies the turtle that is the furthest to the left and facing left (270 degrees), changes its pen color to black, and counts the number of turtles facing left.
